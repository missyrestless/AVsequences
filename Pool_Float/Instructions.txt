AVsitter Sequence for Lalou Pool Float
======================================

This folder contains the 'AVpos' and '[AV]sequence_settings' notecards for use with the 'AVsitter2' plugin '[AV]sequence' to provide animation sequences for the adult version of the Lalou Pool Float dialog menus.

This 'AVsitter' customization allows greater freedom of personal interaction in the pool float, eliminating the need to navigate dialog menus during moments of intimacy.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------------

This customization of the Lalou Pool Float only works with the adult version of the float available on the Second Life Marketplace at https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Lalou-Pool-Float-Adult-3some-441-anims-3some-PV-INM/24299030

This product does NOT contain the Lalou Pool Float. You have to purchase the float from Lalou. This product only contains the notecards and scripts used to provide sequenced animations for the float.

In order to deploy this customization it will be necessary to edit the float object. Detailed instructions are provided below but if you are not comfortable editing Second Life objects then this may be viewed as an opportunity to learn or as something not for you.

Setup
=====

To configure a Lalou Pool Float with AVsitter sequences:

- Right click the float and select 'Edit'

- Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence_settings' notecard into the Contents tab

- Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence' plugin script into the Contents tab

- Replace the 'AVpos' notecard in the Contents tab with the 'AVpos' notecard found in this folder
  - Drag and Drop the original `AVpos` notecard from the Contents tab into your inventory as a backup
  - Delete the `AVpos` notecard from the Contents tab (you can ignore and close the Warning window)
  - Drag and Drop the new `AVpos` notecard with sequences into the Contents tab

- Close the 'Edit' window

- Right click the float and select 'More' -> 'More' -> 'Scripts' -> 'Reset Scripts'

- Wait for the scripts to reset (this takes a few minutes)

Sit on the float, select Male or Female, and click one of the main menu entries, e.g. click 'Cuddles' or 'Adult' then 'Foreplay'.

You should see a menu entry of the form 'SEQ-...'. Click this menu entry and your avatar will cycle through all the animations in that submenu. Cycle times are currently set to 60 seconds with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation, or pause animation sequencing.

Auto Play Sequence
==================

If you wish to automatically play a sequence when an avatar sits on the float then drag & drop the 'autoplay' script into the Contents of the object.

The 'autoplay' script detects the gender of the sitter and plays the appropriate sequence. In addition, it detects the number of sitters currently on the object and plays the couples animation sequence if there are 2 sitters and one of the 3-way sequences if 3 are seated.
